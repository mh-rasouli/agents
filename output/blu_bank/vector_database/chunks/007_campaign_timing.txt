[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- Esfand (February/March) - Pre-Nowruz spending: High consumer engagement and spending
- Shahrivar (August/September) - Back to school/University: High consumer engagement and spending
- Azar (November/December) - Yalda Night and online shopping festivals: High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram (Ashura/Tasu'a) for upbeat lifestyle ads
- Ramadan fasting hours for food-related cross-promotions

Cultural context: Nowruz is the peak for 'Eidi' (gift money). Blu should promote digital 'Eidi' via its easy transfer features.
