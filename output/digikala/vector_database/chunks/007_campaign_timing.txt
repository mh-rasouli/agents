[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- Esfand (Feb-Mar) for Nowruz: High consumer engagement and spending
- Azar (Nov-Dec) for Yalda & Black Friday equivalent: High consumer engagement and spending
- Mehr (Sept) for Back-to-School: High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram (Ashura)
- Ramadan daylight hours for food-heavy advertising
- Official mourning days

Cultural context: Nowruz requires themes of renewal and gifting; Yalda focuses on family gatherings and nuts/fruits/electronics.
