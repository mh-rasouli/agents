[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- Esfand (Pre-Nowruz): High consumer engagement and spending
- Shahrivar (End of Summer): High consumer engagement and spending
- Ramadan: High consumer engagement and spending
- Yalda Night: High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram
- Days of national mourning
- Exam seasons (Khordad) for youth-centric campaigns

Cultural context: Summer is peak grilling/picnic season; Winter is peak comfort food/pasta season.
