[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- Esfand (February/March): High consumer engagement and spending
- Mehr (September): High consumer engagement and spending
- Yalda Night (December): High consumer engagement and spending
- Ramadan: High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram (Ashura/Tasu'a) for celebratory or humorous ads.
- Massive political election weeks where ad space is cluttered and expensive.

Cultural context: Nowruz requires high-energy, celebratory messaging. Ramadan requires focus on health, family Iftar gatherings, and value packs.
