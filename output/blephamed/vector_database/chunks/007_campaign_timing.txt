[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- February-March (Pre-Nowruz): High consumer engagement and spending
- May-June (Allergy Season): High consumer engagement and spending
- October (Health Literacy Month): High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram
- National mourning days (low commercial engagement)

Cultural context: During Ramadan, late-night usage of digital screens increases, leading to dry eye and the need for ocular hygiene awareness.
