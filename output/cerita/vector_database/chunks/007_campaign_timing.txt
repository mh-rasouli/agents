[CAMPAIGN TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS]

Optimal campaign periods for maximum impact:
- February to March (Pre-Nowruz): High consumer engagement and spending
- May to June (Wedding Season): High consumer engagement and spending
- November to December (Yalda and Black Friday): High consumer engagement and spending

Periods to avoid for commercial campaigns:
- First 10 days of Muharram
- Ramadan daytime hours (focus on Iftar to Sahar digital ads instead)

Cultural context: Dryness in winter requires heavy promotion of scalp treatments; summer requires focus on lash growth for 'natural' beach looks.
